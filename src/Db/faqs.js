        question: <p><strong> How does Oat Milk compare to dairy/other milks?</strong></p>,
        answer: <p>Oat Milk stands out for its remarkably lower environmental impact when compared to dairy and other milk alternatives. It requires 80% less land, emits less than one-third of the greenhouse gas emissions, and consumes only 4% of the water needed to produce one liter of dairy milk. When compared to other alternative plant-based options, particularly Almond Milk, Oat Milk demands significantly less water resources, land usage, and reliance on pesticides and fertilizers. Moreover, almond trees heavily rely on bee pollination, which can stress bee populations and even lead to colony collapses. This stark difference highlights Oat Milk as a more sustainable choice for environmentally conscious consumers.</p>
